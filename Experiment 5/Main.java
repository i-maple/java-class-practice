Write a Java program that uses reflection to dynamically load and instantiate a class. Create a class called "DynamicClass" with a method called displayMessage() that prints "Hello, Reflection!". In the main program, use reflection to load the "DynamicClass" and invoke the displayMessage() method. Explain the concept of reflection and how it allows Java programs to examine or modify their own structure at runtime.
